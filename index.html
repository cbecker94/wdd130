            <p>My name is Charity I currently live in Kalispell Montana. I have 6 children, one is married, four are still at home and one is serving a mission.
            I currently work for an MSP as a field engineer. I love my family and enjoy doing most anything with them. I love the outdoors and puzzles. One
            thing I like about myself is even though I am older, and it is not always easy, I am still pursuing my goal of getting my bachelorâ€™s degree.</p>
